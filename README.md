This is a Simple Startup project for beginners to learn about sensors and using them as input to controll another device
This builds up the concept of smart bins that senses if you are about to drop trash in the bin and it opens up.
This project senses if your hand, or any object, is about 10cm close to you and lights up the LED
The data is read from the ultrasonic sensor.

An ultrasonic sensor is a type of sensor that uses sound to measure distance between it and object
This is done by sending a high frequency sound wave pulses through its trigger part and when the sound hits and object, it gets reflected back which the signal is received by its echo part
By knowing the speed of sound in air and the time taken for a signal to travel from the trigger part to the echo part, and since the pulses must have travelled 2d i.e. the to-and-fro journey, one can find the distance d between the object and the ultrasonic sensor.
